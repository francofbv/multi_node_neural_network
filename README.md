# Multi-Node Neural Network

## A teaching and learning tool


This project was created with the intention of using it to teach those less familiar with machine learning how neural networks operate in the forward and backward pass. The network follows a very basic feed-forwards structure and uses mean squared error in the backward pass to make it easy to follow for those who would like to learn more about machine learning!
